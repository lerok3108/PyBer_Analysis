# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project was  to perform exploratory analysis of Pyber ride sharing data in order to gain understanding of key metrics by the types of cities in which Pyber operates(urban, suburban, and rural).Based on the analysis, recommendations were made that addressed disparities among the city types to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
## Results
### A Ride-sharing Summary by City Type

During the first phase of the project, the new dataframe was created that organized data and summarized it by city type. As a result of the analysis, it is evident that rural areas have the least amount of drivers which drives the average fare per ride and fare per driver up. Suburban areas also have higher prices and less drivers compared to the urban areas, which enjoy abundance of drivers and lower prices. Riders living in the suburban and rural areas could be taking longer trips which could possibly result in higher fares per ride. There is no data to further investigate this.  Drivers operating in the urban areas  are also responsible for the majority of the revenue generated by the company and also constitute the majority of drivers providing service for this company.  

## Recommendations
Based on the results of the analysis, current recommendations are:
- to increase the number of drivers in the rural areas first as these areas are the most underserved which results in higher prices. Lower fares can bring more riders who at the current rates are not able to ride with the company. Higher fares also demonstrate that there is demand in the area for more drivers.  
- to increase the number of drivers in the suburban areas as these areas also have higher prices than urban cities and not enough drivers to meet the demand. Fares have also been on the rise, which shows that demand is increasing in these areas. 
- to continue maintaining the number of drivers in the urban areas as these areas are responsible for generating the most revenue for the company. 
- Further analysis could be performed if the length of trips can be collected and compared against the number of trips.
